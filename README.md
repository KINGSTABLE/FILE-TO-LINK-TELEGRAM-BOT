## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the bot up and running. No coding experience? No problem! We‚Äôll guide you through each step.

1. **Get the Code**:
   - Clone the repository to your computer.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/KINGSTABLE/FILE-TO-LINK-TELEGRAM-BOT.git
     cd FILE-TO-LINK-TELEGRAM-BOT
     ```
   - **No Git?** Download the code as a ZIP from the GitHub page and unzip it.

2. **Install Python**:
   - Make sure Python 3.8 or higher is installed. Check by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```
   - If not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt in the `file-to-link-bot` folder.
   - Install all required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - **Windows Users (Optional)**: For better file type detection, install `python-magic`:
     ```bash
     pip install python-magic
     ```
   - **Troubleshooting**: If `pip` doesn‚Äôt work, try `pip3` or ensure Python is added to your system‚Äôs PATH. If you see errors, make sure you‚Äôre in the correct folder with `requirements.txt`.

4. **Set Up API Credentials**:
   - Open the `file_to_link_bot.py` file in a text editor (like Notepad or VS Code).
   - Replace these values with your own:
     - `API_ID`: Your Telegram API ID from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
     - `API_HASH`: Your Telegram API Hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org).
     - `BOT_TOKEN`: Your bot token from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
     - `GOFILE_API_TOKEN`: Your token from [Gofile.io](https://gofile.io).
   - **How to Get Credentials**:
     - **Telegram**: Log in to [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org), create an app, and copy the API ID and Hash. Then, message [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram, use `/newbot`, and follow the prompts to get a bot token.
     - **Gofile.io**: Sign up at [Gofile.io](https://gofile.io), go to account settings, and generate an API token.
   - Save the file after updating.

5. **Create a Downloads Folder**:
   - The bot needs a folder to temporarily store files. Create it in the `file-to-link-bot` folder:
     ```bash
     mkdir downloads
     ```
   - **Windows Users**: You can also create a folder named `downloads` manually in the project directory.

6. **Run the Bot Locally**:
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     python file_to_link_bot.py
     ```
   - If it works, the bot will start and connect to Telegram. Test it by messaging your bot on Telegram with `/start`.
   - **Troubleshooting**: Ensure all credentials are correct. If you see errors, double-check the API tokens and installed libraries.

7. **Deploy to Zeabur (Optional)**:
